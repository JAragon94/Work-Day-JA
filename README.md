# Work-Day-JA
A Work Day Scheduler

I created a schedule to help employees plan and to add important
events to a daily planner, so that one can manage time effectively.
Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
you can enter an event when you click the save button for that time block,
then the text for that event is saved in local storage.
When you refresh the page then the saved events persist
